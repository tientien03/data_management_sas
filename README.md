Description: Through SAS, we preprocess the Student Performance Factors dataset by cleaning, transforming, and reducing the data, ensuring it is consistent and reliable. From there, we use the statistics generated to tell a meaningful storyâ€”showing how study habits, family background, lifestyle, and daily routines shape student performance and highlight the key factors that drive success.
